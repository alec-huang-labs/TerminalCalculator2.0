## Terminal Scientific Calculator

Built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and the React Library. In the Freecodecamp Front End Development curriculum, one of the suggested projects was to to build a simple calculator. I wanted to give my calculator extra features so I ended up building a scientific calculator that utilizes the [mathjs] library. I gave it a cool 80s retro computer terminal interface as well. 

You can view the project [Here](https://alec-huang-labs.github.io/TerminalCalculator2.0/).

[This](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19WdfPLXQY7G-XYjm_jyVTeGN9FolCXET/view?pli=1) is a quick walkthrough video I made for the application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get the project in your IDE:
1. Open your terminal and change your directory to where you would like the project to be cloned.
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/alec-huang-labs/TerminalCalculator2.0.git`. This will clone the repository to your computer. 
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies for the project.
4. Run `npm start` to view the Calculator in your local broswer
5. Run `npm test` to run the test files.
