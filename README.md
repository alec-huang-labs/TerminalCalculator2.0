## Terminal Scientific Calculator

Built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and the React Library. In the Freecodecamp Front End Development curriculum, one of the suggested projects was to to build a simple calculator. I wanted to give my calculator extra features so I ended up building a scientific calculator that utilizes the [mathjs] library. I gave it a cool 80s retro computer terminal interface as well. 

You can view the project [Here](https://alec-huang-labs.github.io/TerminalCalculator2.0/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
